## Requirements

This header-only library has no other dependencies than the C++ Standard Library and is continuously being tested with the following conforming [C++20](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4868.pdf) compilers:

| Platform | Compiler   | Versions   | Build |
| :------- | :-------   | :-------   | :---- |
| Linux    | GCC        | 12, 13-SVN | CI currently being ported to GitHub Actions |
| Linux    | Clang      | 16, 17-SVN | CI currently being ported to GitHub Actions |

Note that this library makes liberal use of C++20 features. Visual Studio is catching up fast, and will be added as soon as possible.
